## Dice Roll Anatomy

**\[Script + Skill + Misc.]**

> Whenever a player wants to resolve an action and failure has consequence, they should make a roll. This game uses a dice pool system in which a player can take a relevant die from their core attributes, skill, and misc. Making the average die pool have at most 3 dice.

## Creating Checks

Checks are represented using the DvR system or Difficulty vs Risk. Difficulty represents how hard it is to accomplish the task while Risk represents repercussions and possible degrees of success. Players roll their die pool. Every die that meets or beats the difficulty rating is counted as a success. The player needs to generate enough successes to be at least equal to the risk rating to have a complete success otherwise they had partial success/failure.

These checks are represented using DvR. Examples include 5v2, 6v3, etc. Most common and normal rolls are a 4v1 of normal difficulty needing only one success to complete the roll. A 4vX roll where the R of the roll is labeled as X means that the risk is irrelevant.

> [!Note to the GM]
> It is usually better to increase or decrease the difficulty of a roll rather than adding numbers to dice. It makes it easier for the player to calculate

## Optional Rule: Untrained Rolls

When players aren't trained in a roll they can use their core die and no skill die. Whatever misc die is applicable could also be used

# Critical Die

## Success

Whenever two of the same number are rolled that aren't a 1, these count as a success. For every extra matching die rolled, an additional success is granted meaning that a lucky roll of (4,4,4) on a 4vX check generated 5 total successes.

## Failure

Every die that rolled a 1 cancels a success. Failing a check without successes and having a natural 1 makes the roll a critical failure.

# Player Characters

---

## Die ratings

Players, items, environments, enemies, etc. Most of the influential factors in this system are represented through a die size scaling from d4 to d12.

## Core characteristics

players are composed of core attributes that define their main aspects. This is called their script which is composed off...

- Stamina
  - A character's ability to endure physical and mental endurance for extended periods of time
- Charm
  - A character's likeability and social influence.
- Reflex
  - The quickness and raw reaction time of a character.
- Ingenuity
  - A Character's intellect and ability of though process
- Power
  - A character's raw strength and physical ability
- Toughness
  - A Character's physical endurance.

> Characters will then select one of their script aspects. This is called their focus die. It is the defining trait of a character. It can change, grow, or diminish over time but it is used to represent a character's defining and guiding principles.

### Health points

Health represents a characters physical stability. This is usually calculated by adding the toughness stat and the power stat together plus 3.

### Focus points

Focus points represent a characters ability to push their rolls. This is calculated with 3 + a characters focus die.

### Spending Points

Players can use either their health points or their focus points to push a roll at a 1 to 1 conversion rate. Focus points are easily recovered in comparison to health.

### Reaching 0 points

When health reaches 0 a character is physically unable to act while reaching 0 focus points means a character is mentally exhausted and is unable to act until they are able to take a quick breath while health needs the character to heal or rest.

## Skills

Whenever a player is trained or gifted in a specific subset of abilities they have a skill rating. Different settings have different selections of skills. A generic skill list would be

- Academics
- Animal
- Brawl
- Deception
- Engineering
- First Aid
- Gymnastics
- Intimidation
- Investigation
- Lore
- Nature
- Persuasion
- Stealth
- Scoundrel
- Survival

## Misc Section

Misc can be separated into different categories such as inventory, a more detailed version of an item, a personal vehicle, pet, etc.

### Item Examples

| Name          | Description                                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| God Ender     | 8 damage d10 weapon. Applies Killable condition to immortal creatures |
| Simple Weapon | d6, 2 damage                                                          |

## Wear and Tear

### All or Nothing ruling

Items can be sacrificed to double their output. This means that the amount of successes they generate are doubled. If the item deals damage, then its damage is also doubled. The drawback of this is that the item will be destroyed after being used. The GM will decide if the item is completely destroyed or if it can be repaired.

### Rusting

Items can have a rust value attached to them to show their current condition. For every point of rust an item gains the die value is stepped down and its damage is also taken down by one. Rust can be removed by taking care of weapons, paying people to clean up your items, or by GM discretion.

### Narrative Items

Narrative items represent a broad genre of item that can be specified when used. For example a player can buy supplies for hunting. When used these can be represented as a torch, food, a cheap bow, etc. Some items may have a higher cost than others. So a simple rope may only cost one supply narrative item, but something like the specific items for a ritual to banish a ghost might take up 2 or 3 narrative items.

## Starting Stats

| Type of game | Skill points    | Core |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---- |
| Heroic       | # of skills     | 8    |
| Normal       | 3/4 # of skills | 5    |
| Gritty       | 1/2 # of skills | 3    |

## Leveling Up

Hard Difficulty

| Level | Xp   |
| ----- | ---- |
| 1     | 200  |
| 2     | 400  |
| 3     | 600  |
| 4     | 800  |
| 5     | 1000 |

Normal Difficulty

| Level | Xp  |
| ----- | --- |
| 1     | 100 |
| 2     | 200 |
| 3     | 300 |
| 4     | 400 |
| 5     | 500 |

Core characteristics are the same but multiplied by 2

## Critical Success Level Up

Players can level up a skill or attribute that has had a crit in its roll the moment that the crit happens at a discount of the crit number times 10.

> Example: Jessie rolled (5,5,3) on a 4v2 roll succeeding the roll but also scoring a crit. They used their Reflex and Gunplay skills on their roll so they can choose either of those die values to upgrade. Jessie decides to level up his gunplay from lvl2 to lvl3 given at a discount of 50 xp resulting in buying the skill for 250xp rather than 300xp

#### Trained Level Up

To level up a skill a character must first perform a successful check with that skill. A skill can be shown as prepped for level up by drawing a dot on the next level square.

## Perks

Players can acquire perks to better represent aspects of their character's personality, specialties, quirks, etc. Some perks can have positive and/or negative consequences. Some perks allow players to use certain mechanics that are otherwise inaccessible to untrained characters.

# Extra Character Rules

## Burdens

Whenever players interact with something supernatural/following the plot despite their best interests they gain a burden. Burdens can be exchanged for xp by healing them, but having too many burdens can lead to a character suffering a crisis.

# Crisis

A player has to roll a crisis roll a d20 above their splinter value to succeed a save. If the player fails the roll, then they enter into crisis mode.

> [!ALERT] Note to the GM
> A crisis can be used to represent different conditions such as notoriety, responsibility, corruption, etc.

# Conflict

---

## Initiative

Usually initiative in this system is started by the aggressor, then they are able to pick who goes next in a popcorn like initiative until every actor in a scene has acted at least once. Keep in mind that this means that whoever goes last can choose to go first in the next round.

# Combat with versatile weapons

Players are faced with a DvR roll where D is the difficulty of landing the blow and R is the resistance of the target. For example, 1 might be someone wearing everyday clothes, 2 might be light armor, 3 heavy armor, etc.

The weapon has a number associated to it. For example (Gun D6. damage: 4) The weapons damage can be spent similar to focus points. The player must get a success in their roll to deal any form of damage. Players can use all of their point pools to help their roll. Whatever remains from their damage pool is the damage that is dealt. On a critical success, the weapon deals half (rounded up) of its damage to the target.

> [!Optional Rules]
>
> - An extra success lets you deal +1 damage
> - A crit lets you deal a condition to the target

> I roll to hit someone wearing light armor. They are behind some light cover so the Gm rules that the roll is a 5v2. 5 because of the light cover, 2 because of the light armor I roll Reflex, Gunplay and my Gun (Damage: 4) My dice values are 3, 4, 2 If this is my final roll I will have missed because I rolled no successes. I can spend one of my damage gun's points to get my 4 up to a 5 making my roll but lowering my gun's damage to a 3. 3, 5, 2. My attack will still miss since I need two successes to land the blow, but I want my weapon to deal some damage so I will push my roll by spending focus instead of damage points. 5, 5, 2. I have now landed my shot and my weapon deals 3 damage, but I lost 2 focus points. I could have also dealt 1 damage and spent no focus if I only pushed my roll with only my gun's damage points`

## Conditions

- Dazed: -2 focus points
- Stunned: Can't go this turn
- Pinned: Can't move this turn
- Narrative condition: Target's next check's difficulty is increased by one (This can be anything from blinded, flanked, etc.)

# Travel

# Analogs

## What is an analog?

An analog is a specific die mechanic that can be used to represent specific actions or sequences.

## Quick vehicles

Quick vehicles are similar to items. They have a misc die attached to them and they can also have a point rating that can boost different parts of a roll.

### The duel

When 2 actors are facing each other in a 1v1, this is called a duel. A duel has a global health score going from a negative number to its positive number. A simple duel goes from -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3 while a complex duel has a score of -5 to 5. Players deal their damage to the health score. Whoever deals enough damage to exceed their side wins the duel.

# GMs

## Awarding experience points

While in most ttrpgs experience is awarded at the end of a story arc or after combat, it is also important to understand that p points are an incentive to players and awarding them for certain behaviors will just reinforce certain behaviors. If you want players to interact with the story, engage with mystery and talk to npcs, you should award small bits of xp to players who engage in dialogue. If you want a bit more engagement out of players, you could also award xp whenever a they solve a clue, ask a leading question, or go through a productive conversation.

> [!Note to the Gm]
> Award the behavior you want in the game

## The Narrative Pools

### Using the environment

Players can interact with their surroundings using misc die. Whether its hiding behind a d8 crowd, or flying through a d10 asteroid field, etc. As a GM you can invoke and declare different scenarios, zones, items, etc represented through a die value

### Using GM points

### Buying 1s

Whenever a 1 is rolled instead of having it detract from a success the GM can buy it to get Gm points which can be used to cause intrusions and detract from a player's future rolls.

# Strategized Combat

If you want combat to be strategy based then there is no initiative in a turn unless stated otherwise. All actions are done at the same time meaning that if an enemy's damage is still dealt even if they are killed in that turn, unless stated otherwise. This incentivises players to be strategic on their actions and evade or try to slow enemies down and create openings for other players. There are also cases where one combatant can go before or after the concurrent turn.

Once all players have coordinated their turn they can lock in their actions and the GM then reveals theirs. If anyone has advantage, their turn goes first. Then all remaining combatants go next, and finally disadvantaged combatants go last.

If using minis you have to commit to a movement by having it be either towards or against an item, position, or combatant. The actual distance moved can be changed from 0 up to your max speed. It is up to GM discretion to decide how movements should go.

#### Optional rule:

Movement goes as follows. Dashers, regular movement, and dodgers. This way characters who are running decide where they go first. Then regular movement happens, then whoever dodge can place themselves in the best location.

#### Mixed intuit rule:

This makes initiative take turns rather than having the vague rules

## Entering a town

When entering a town there is a list of things you can do

- Talk to the town master
- Visit the shop
- Visit the smith
- Rest

# IDEAS

- Having burdens be built up and act like mental breaks from the darkest dungeon. Rolld 100 on table and add current burden count up to 130
- Create buildings to level up or create characters with certain skills
- Timepass turns where characters age and things get built in town. Dungeon mutates
- Dark magic has an effect on the town. Doesn’t affect humans but can affect longer living races more.
- Leaving a legacy to other characters
- Creating elevators to different dungeon levels
- Missions to other towns in the world but still tied back to the town
- Creating secondary characters (Maybe link up to outside missions)
- Supply system
- Magic system
- Potion system
- Levelup system
- Characters gain secondary xp called legacy points. These can also be bought with xp. These let you buy stuff for the town and future characters
- Lifepath for creating characters growing up in town
